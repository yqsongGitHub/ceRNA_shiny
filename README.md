# ceRNA_shiny
ceRNAshiny, an interactive R/Shiny application, which integrates widely used computational methods and databases to provide and visualize the construction and analysis of ceRNA network, including differential gene analysis and functional annotation. In addition, demo data in ceRNAshiny could provide the ceRNA network analyses about neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease. Overall, ceRNAshiny is a user-friendly application that benefits all researchers, especially those who lack an established bioinformatic pipeline and are interested in studying ceRNA networks.

# Launch ceRNAshiny
ceRNAshiny does not need to be installed and is hosted on Shinyapps.so: https://cerna.shinyapps.io/cerna_shiny/.

# Usage
See [ceRNAshiny](https://cerna.shinyapps.io/cerna_shiny/) mannul and example use cases pages for further details.

The modules are as follows:
1. Heatmap plot
2. Volcanol plot
3. Enrichment
4. RNA classification
5. ceRNA network1: ceRNA network based on PCC, SPCC and PC
6. ceRNA network2: ceRNA network based on databases 
7. ceRNA network3: ceRNA network based on PCC and databases
